        <h2>What is Herd Immunity?</h2>
        <p>
            Herd immunity is refers to the concept the group protection from an infectious disease that emerges when critical mass of
            the population are immunized from that recieving the disease. In the majority of cases, immunization stems from
            recieving vaccination against the disease. These immunized people in the community reduce the odds that a disease
            can spread from person to person. In other words, persons that are not immune to disease can still be shielded
            against contracting it by virtue of others in the population being unable to pass it on. The greater number of
            people immune to a disease, the less likely of a chance that someone vulnerable to the disease will contract
            it. Herd immunity is important because there people who cannot be vaccinated against certain diseases such as
            those who are too young, too old, or allergic to the vaccination. These people must rely on those around to get
            vaccinated so that the diease has lower odds of spreading to them.

        <h2>Calculating Herd Immunity</h2>
        <p>
            A population is deemed to have achieved herd immunity against an infectious disease outbreak when they have reached or surpassed
            the herd immunity threshold, denoted as Qc. To calculate the value of Q c, one would need to know the basic reproductive
            rate of the specific disease, denoted as R 0. R0 is a numeric measure representing the average number of infections
            made by that specific disease based on it's various attibutes such as method of spread and duration if infection.
            The higher that number is, the more infectious the disease is said to be. Using the entire equation, we can determine
            the herd immunity threshold calculated by solving for the equation Qc = 1 – (1/R0). For example, mumps can have
            a R0 of 7, so we can subsitute it in giving us 1 - (1/7) = 0.86, which, when converted int o percentage, yields
            a herd immunity threshold of approximately 86%. One additional step required to determine the vaccination rate
            needed for the population. This equation makes the assumption that vaccination against the disease would be 100
            percent effective. In reality, vaccines are not perfectly effective. Therefore to calculate the vaccination rate
            needed for herd immunity, we also need to divide Qc by the effectiveness of the vaccine denoted as (E). Thus
            the percentage of the population required need to vaccinated to reach the herd immunity threshold can be approximated
            asVc = Qc/E. Going with the previous mumps example, two doses of the mumps vaccine result a effectiveness of
            88%. When converted to a decimal, we can get the equation 0.86/0.88 = 0.97, which converts to 97%. So 97% of
            the population is actually needed to achieve herd immunity against mumps! When the vaccination coverage of a
            population has the necessary percentage for herd immunity, the disease is thought off as "contained".

        <h2>Your Turn</h2>
        <p>
            Watch the effect of vaccination and herd immunity in action by simulating your own outbreak. In the simulation you will be
            able to modify the reproductive rate of your disease, the effectiveness of the vaccination against it and
            the vaccination rate of the population. In the simulation, your fictitious disease will have ten attempts
            infect someone in a population of 250 people. Each time the disease infects a person, it will spread twice
            according to the reproductive rate you set – once to the R0 number of closest neighbors from the initial
            infection, and then again for each of the neighbors infected. To incorporate some real life randomness, the
            location distribution of the vaccinated, unvaccinated and vaccinated but vulnerable is randomly distributed. This will cause some variation the
            simulation, but you view see the average results on the line graph.
